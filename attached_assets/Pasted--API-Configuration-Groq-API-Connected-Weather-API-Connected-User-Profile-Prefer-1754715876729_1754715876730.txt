🌾 Agricultural Advice (Confidence: 84%):

Based on the provided weather data and agricultural context, here's specific weather-based agricultural advice for the farmer:

Immediate Actions:

Monitor soil moisture: With the forecasted rain, it's essential to monitor soil moisture levels closely. Check the soil regularly to ensure it's not waterlogged, which can lead to root rot and other issues.
Adjust irrigation: Given the expected rainfall, reduce irrigation to avoid overwatering. This will help prevent waterlogged soil and reduce the risk of disease.
Apply fungicides and pesticides: With the high chance of rain, it's crucial to apply fungicides and pesticides to prevent disease and pest infestations.
Risks to Watch For:

Waterlogging: With the heavy rainfall forecasted, there's a risk of waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and other issues.
Disease: The high humidity and rainfall can increase the risk of disease, especially fungal diseases.
Pest infestations: The rain can attract pests, which can lead to infestations and damage to the crop.
Protective Measures:

Use crop covers: Apply crop covers to protect the cotton crop from excessive rain and wind damage.
Install drainage systems: Ensure the farm has proper drainage systems in place to prevent waterlogging.
Monitor crop health: Regularly monitor crop health to detect any signs of disease or pest infestations early on.
Additional Recommendations:

Keep an eye on temperature: Although the temperature is within the optimal range for cotton growth, keep an eye on it to ensure it doesn't drop below 21°C, which can affect growth.
Maintain farm records: Keep detailed records of weather conditions, soil moisture, and crop health to help identify trends and make informed decisions.
Confidence Factors:

Based on the provided data, I'd rate the confidence in the weather forecast as 85%. The 7-day forecast shows a high chance of rain, which is typical for the Kharif season in the region. However, there's always a chance of errors in weather forecasting, and it's essential to remain vigilant and adapt to changing conditions.

By following these recommendations, the farmer can minimize risks and ensure a healthy crop growth.
