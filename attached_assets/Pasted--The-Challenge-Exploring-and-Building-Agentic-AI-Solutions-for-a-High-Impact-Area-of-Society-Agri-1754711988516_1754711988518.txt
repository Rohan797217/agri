**The Challenge: Exploring and Building Agentic AI Solutions for a High-Impact Area of Society: Agriculture**
Agriculture is a high-impact area of Indian society which is well-suited to continuous innovation and experimentation with data, analytics, and AI/ML. AI-driven solutions in this sector have potential to help farmers and others in this sector help answer questions like:
* “When should I irrigate?”
* “What seed variety suits this unpredictable weather?”
* “Will next week’s temperature drop kill my yield?”
* “Can I afford to wait for the market to improve?”
* “Where can I get affordable credit, and will any state/central government policy help me with finances?”
In this challenge, the questions above may require a multi-modal agentic solution for real-time answering. And the hypothetical user constraints to consider are many, such as lack of internet access.
Your AI agent could potentially address a lot of local constraints if it could:
* Understand local, natural-language queries
* Synthesize insights across domains like weather, crop cycles, pest science, soil health, finance
* Infer meaning, adapt to context, and explain its answers
* Be usable by someone with low digital access but high decision responsibility
You will have to tackle:
* Noisy, incomplete, non-standard public datasets
* Multilingual, code-switched, colloquial questions
* Hallucination risks in LLMs and grounding in facts
* Design for reliability, explainability, and trust
* Real-world edge cases, where the wrong answer has real costs
From retrieval to reasoning, interface to insight, you will need to bring your best thinking in AI/ML, software, product and design.
**The task is to build a human-aligned AI-powered advisor which could be used for all sorts of agri-related queries. These could include input materials, crops, harvest, finance or policy related queries. The solution aims to be highly accessible to multiple demographic regions of India and could be aimed at a farmer, financier, vendor or any node in the agricultural industry.**
Important Note: Participants can only use publicly available datasets.
We call for the participants to utilize a myriad of hyperlocal unstructured datasets available through public portals. All participants are individually responsible for complying with the terms and conditions of the datasets you use and abide by them, including citing and sourcing the datasets.
Wonder why we chose this problem statement?
The goal is to discover innovation that emerges as the participants solve these problems. Innovation across different sectors and industries can expand the possibilities of AI. Participants will address complex challenges and demonstrate how their talent can drive transformative change in diverse fields. We imagine that the challenges addressed through the solution would be domain-agnostic and apply universally.
